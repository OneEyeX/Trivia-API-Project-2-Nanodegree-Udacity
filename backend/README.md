# TRIVIA APP 
## Project DOCUMENTATION

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). 

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development 
Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.

#### Backend

From the backend folder run `pip install requirements.txt`. All required packages are included in the requirements file. 

To run the application run the following commands: 
```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development 
flask run
```

These commands put the application in development and directs our application to use the `__init__.py` file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made. If running locally on Windows, look for the commands in the [Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/factory/).

The application is run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration. 

#### Frontend

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client: 
```
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start 
```

By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000. 

### Tests
In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands: 

```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command. 


All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality. 

## API Reference

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "Bad request"
}
```
The API will return 4 error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad request
- 404: Page not found
- 422: Unprocessable resource
- 500: Internal server error

### Endpoints
